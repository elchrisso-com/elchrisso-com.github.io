# **Gifts**

Sincerely, your presence at our wedding is the best gift of all.
However, should you wish to honour us with a present, we would be most grateful for a contribution towards our honeymoon fund for a trip to Bohol in the Philippines (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohol); a trip that is turning out expensive due to the avaricious overspend of the honeymoon-industrial complex.

If you _really_ want to get us a physical item, please contact Maria or Chris for the suggested gift list.
