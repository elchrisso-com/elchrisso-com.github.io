Please arrive at the church before 1.30 pm for the ceremony, which will be officiated by the Reverend Sam Aldred.
The church is [Bodin Kirke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodin_Church), a lovely historic building.
After the service, those attending the meal can walk over to the venue. It is a flat, 5-minute walk.

## **Dinner**
For those joining the dinner, it will start shortly after the church service. 
Details are [here](/the-dinner/index.md).

## **Reception**
The reception will start at 8 pm.
We are providing beer and wine for the reception, along with some buffet-style party food and wedding cake. 
You are also welcome to bring your own alcohol, mixers, and food if you like, which can be stored in one of the buildings. This is encouraged if you plan to get completely _on it_.

The reception will include (but is not limited to):
- music
- dancing
- speeches
- silliness
- partying
- mad uncles and insane aunts

You have been warned.

## **Dress Code**
There is no formal dress code; however, please try to avoid dark colours if you can. Colourful bow ties are encouraged. High heels are fine, but remember to bring your [dancing shoes](https://open.spotify.com/track/0hAMkY2kwdXPPDfQ1e3BmJ?si=9105ced2e53f4c4f). If it rains, an umbrella is a good idea.
