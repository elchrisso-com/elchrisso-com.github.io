Please arrive at the church from 1.15 pm for the ceremony, which will be officiated by the Reverend Sam Aldred.

After the service, those attending the meal can walk over to the venue. It is a flat, 5-minute walk.

## **Dress Code**

There is no formal dress code so just dress smart (suits and dresses); however, please try to avoid dark colours if you can. Colourful bow ties are encouraged. High heels are fine, but remember to bring your [dancing shoes](https://open.spotify.com/track/0hAMkY2kwdXPPDfQ1e3BmJ?si=9105ced2e53f4c4f). If it rains, an umbrella is a good idea.
