## Wedding info (updated: 13 Sep. '24)
Welcome to the wedding information page. This page is not yet complete, but will be updated with facts and guides as we have chance to update it over the next year.

Eventually we plan to offer more advice for travel, tourism and all sorts.

## FAQ
- Q: Will there be space for kids.
- A: Young children (babs to todlingers) yes. The venue has three locations. The dinner house, the reception house and the party barn. The reception house will have facilities for young children, and they can be housed in prams / on laps for the dinner (that is up to you). Due to limited space at dinner, we unfortunately cannot offer seats to children for the wedding meal. Of course they are welcome in the reception house, and at the party if they wish to trip the light fantastic. 

- Q: What will the weather be like?
- A: We are not sure yet, please take a look in the travel-info section where we try to give some idea [here](/wedding/)

- Q: Will there be any Northern Lights?
- A: Unfortunately at the time of year it is extremely unlikely due to the almost constant daylight.

- Q: Why is the groom so unreasonably handsome?
- A: Awwww stop it, you're making me blush.
