# **The Dinner**
For those coming to the dinner (the wedding breakfast), we will walk to the venue from the church---it’s a five-minute walk at most. It’s also within the same grounds as the reception.

Dinner guests should have already been asked, but do please also reply to the Save the Date invitation, which you should receive in the post. Note: Maria still needs to send out some invites for the dinner.

There’s a tight limit on the number of people for the dinner, so unfortunately, it’s not possible to squeeze any more in. If for any reason you or your partner has to drop out, please let us know as soon as possible.
