# **The Dinner**
For those coming to the dinner (the wedding breakfast), we will walk to the venue from the church. It’s a five-minute walk at most. It’s also within the same grounds as the reception.

Dinner guests should have already been asked, but do please also reply to the Save the Date invitation, which you should receive in the post. 

There’s a tight limit on the number of people for the dinner, so unfortunately, it’s not possible to squeeze any more in. If for any reason you or your partner has to drop out, please let us know as soon as possible.

For those not coming to the dinner, there will be light food and drink provided in Staburret (one of the houses on the reception estate) from 4pm to 7.30pm. 

**There will be fish, meat and cheeses and cake; so please inform us of dietary requirements by mid July.**
