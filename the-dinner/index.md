# **The Dinner**
For those coming to the meal, we will walk to the meal venue from the church, it is a five minute walk tops. 
It is also in the same grounds where the recption will be.

There will be reception drinks and we will head into the meal-building.

There is a rather tight limit of 70 people for the meal, so it is not possible to squeeze anymore in. 
If for some reason you or your partner has to drop out last minute, please do let us know as soon as possible so that we can offer the space to others.

The meal will be roughly ... minutes, and include:
- reception drink and amuse bouche
- Starter 
- Main
- Speeches
- Singing
- Wine
- Nonsense
- Music

We will have the wedding cake at the reception afterwards
