## **FAQ**
- Q: Will there be space for kids?
- A: Young children (babs to todlers) yes. The venue has four locations. The dinner house, the reception house, the fancy house, and the party barn. The fancy house will be quieter, and have facilities for young children. They can be housed in prams / on laps for the dinner (that is up to you). Due to limited space at dinner, we can't offer seats to children for the wedding meal. Of course they are welcome everywhere else, including at the party if they wish to trip the light fantastic. 

- Q: What will the weather be like?
- A: We are not sure yet, please take a look in the travel-info section where we try to give some idea [here](/wedding/).

- Q: Will there be any Northern Lights?
- A: In August it is extremely unlikely due to the almost constant daylight.

- Q: Why is the ~~groom~~ best man so unreasonably handsome?
- ~~A: Awwww stop it, you're making me blush.~~
- A: He says it's a matter of who you're standing next to.

Please ask if you have questions.
