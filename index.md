## Wedding info (updated: 13 Sep. '24)
Welcome to the wedding information page. This page is not yet complete, but will be updated with facts and guides as we have chance to update it over the next year. Currently there is a short summary (below), as well as flight and travel info for those wishing to book in early, and a short FAQ. Eventually we plan to offer more advice for travel, tourism and all sorts.

### Date and Location
- The Wedding will take place on 2 August 2025 in Bodo, Norway. You can find it on google maps: <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/g4zBsFW85n4vBDAp6"> here</a>.

## Travel information page
We have provided a short travel information page. This is a bit early to book flights now, but it may be useful to have a look.
