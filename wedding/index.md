## Bodø
Bodø is a town in Northern Norway, located above the artic circle. You can find it on google maps here: <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/4MSZEpyszJbVNWuM8"> here</a>.

Bodo is the gateway to the Lofoten Islands, see below <ref Lofoten>. This area of the world is terrific.

## Getting there
Flying is probably the cheapest and easiest way to get to Bodo.
The major airlines serving Bodo are [SAS](https://www.flysas.com/) and [Norwegian](https://www.norwegian.com/uk/). A good flight checking site for finding flights is [Google flights](https://www.google.com/travel/flights). 
Alternatives such as road, sea and rail are also possible, but will take a lot longer, and we have no personal experience.

### Flying
I find [Google flights](https://www.google.com/travel/flights) provides the best possibilities. Try looking around the end of September/October ('24) to book in tickets early. Below are options from Birmingham and London. If you do fly from somewhere else and find something convenient, please let me know and I will update it here.

#### from Birmingham
There is usually a flight from Birmingham that goes via Copenhagen, Oslo and on to Bodo, with the airline [SAS](https://www.flysas.com/)
Alternatively Manchester airport as well as London Heathrow usually have better and cheaper flights.

#### from London
Check [Google flights](https://www.google.com/travel/flights) and [SAS](https://www.flysas.com/) for flights from London Heathrow (LHR) to Bodo (BOO), for the quickest and most affordable flights. They usually go through Oslo (OSL).

**Note**: Since 2 August is still a long time away now, it may be worth waiting a short time for the airlines to confirm their schedules before booking. But keep an eye.

### By Road
Driving will take a couple of days, but you can get a ferry crossing from the UK to the Netherlands and Denmark to Norway (Oslo) to shorten the trip a bit. Having said that, landing in Oslo and driving from there will be slow going. Nobody drives between cities in Norway, as the country is vast and mountainous. Norway has slow, single track, roads with heavy speeding fines. Better to blast it up through Sweden and cross closer to Bodo at Gradis.

### By Sea
As far as I am aware there is no ferry between Norway and the UK. Maybe you can get one from the Shetland or Orkney Islands, I cannot find anything myself, but if you do discover it, please let me know.

As an alternative option, if you drive, you can take a ferry from Germany to Oslo.

## Weather
The weather is mercurial. It can be warm/cold, windy/still and all sorts even in summer. We are hoping for some warm weather with little rain, as we have outdoor space. We have a lot of indoor space though so it is not a problem if it's bad. A little rain never hurt anyone (but it certainly tried).
We will of course update the suggestions for clothing closer to. As the saying goes, there is no bad weather, only bad clothes.

### Sunshine
In the midsummer in Bodo the sun does not set, but since we will be having the wedding on 2 August, there will be a couple hours of twilight. There may be clouds, which will make it darker, but not dark.

### Wildlife
There are some incredible animals in Norway. In August you may be lucky enough to see the sea eagle and the elk (norsk: elg). There are also whales to see if you can get to them before they shoot ‘em. 

#### Facts about the Elk
The Elk (what a Canadian would call a Moose, example phrase "hey, you're not the same moose from last night!") is in essence a very large deer (Latin: heftus deerus). They exist throughout Norway. They are usually shy, but should not be approached, especially if they have young nearby.

If you do find yourself face to face with an aggressive elk the best course of action is to take the initiate and charge first. Just put your head down, go for it.  And I mean, _really_ go for it. Try grunting too, why not. Remember, you want to catch it off guard, make it think: "hang on, I thought I was meant to be charging them". Note: if you do attempt this, please make sure you have someone on hand film it.
